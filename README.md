# BreatheBar

App that sits in your menu bar and reminds you to take a break to breathe once an hour.

Instead of showing a window or a notification or alert, it just animates the icon until you dismiss it. That way you don't feel stressed to address it immediately if you're in the middle of something; but it's noticeable enough that you can _choose_ to take a break when you come out of deep focus.

Written mostly by a Claude Code agent; I just directed it a bit.
